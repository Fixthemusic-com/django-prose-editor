Change log
==========

Next version
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Extended the README.
- Fixed the initialization in Django admin inlines.
- Added a server-side sanitization callback to the ``ProseEditorField``, and
  added ``django_prose_editor.sanitized.SanitizedProseEditorField`` which
  automatically does the right thing.
- Automatically added a ``get_*_excerpt`` model method to models using the
  ``ProseEditorField`` as a convenience.
- Cleaned up the styles.
- Added a maximum width to the editor.
- Started hiding labels for prose editor fields in the Django admin if the
  label is an empty string. This looks better to me.
- Added a shortcut for adding links.
- Added a button for editing the raw HTML. This is sometimes useful.
- Stopped generating source maps unless in dev mode. I like source maps a lot
  in general, but the files are really big in this case.
- Added a button to the menu to insert horizontal rules.
